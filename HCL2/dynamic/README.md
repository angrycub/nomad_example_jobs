# HCL2 dynamic blocks

These job specifications explore options capable using HCL2's `dynamic` blocks

- **example.nomad** - leverages HCL2 variables with dynamic blocks to create a
  multi-task job specification.

- **math.nomad** - creates a static spread over node sets based on Client
  metadata. It has some rounding issues, but is useful as an inspiration.
