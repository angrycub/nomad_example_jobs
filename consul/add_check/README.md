# Adding a service to a Nomad Job

This example shows a simple Nomad job (`e1.nomad`) which can be run in the
cluster. Running `e2.nomad` will add a Consul check to the job. Adding a check
is a non-destructive operation.

Running `e3.nomad` will cause a destructive change because it adds a job meta
argument which must be dealt with by restarting the workload. This
counterexample helps to illustrate that adding a check is a non-destructive
operation.
